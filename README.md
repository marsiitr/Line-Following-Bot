## ABOUT

This bot is a simple line follower bot using image processing. code is written in python. I used raspberry pi and its camera module( mobile camera can also be used) for line detection.  </br>
Installation of Raspbian (OS for PI) and OpenCV on raspberry pi is time taking process. All the steps to configure raspberry pi are given <a href='https://github.com/Shreeyash-iitr/Line_following_bot/blob/master/Raspberry%20pi-configuration'>here</a> .
